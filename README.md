## Description of the project:

> _Redactr-app is a software tool designed to help users protect sensitive information in text documents. Whether you're dealing with confidential reports, legal documents, personal information, or any other type of data that needs to be kept private, a redact app can help you easily and securely remove any sensitive data._


## Basic Feature:

* This `redactr-app` would allow users to highlight and "`black out`" certain words, phrases, or sections of their documents, replacing them with asterisks, blank spaces, or other characters of their choice. This process is called redaction, and it is an important step in protecting confidential or private information, as it can prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse of sensitive data.

* Redaction is particularly important in industries such as law, healthcare, finance, and government, where the protection of sensitive information is critical. In these industries, redaction is often required by regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (`HIPAA`), the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (`PCI DSS`), or the Freedom of Information Act (`FOIA`).


## Advanced Feature:

* Displays some stats, like how many words were scanned, how many matched the words to be **scrambled**, how many characters were **scrambled** in total, how long it took (in seconds) to complete the scrambling task e.t.c.

* This app can also be used to redact information in a variety of document formats, including `PDF, Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more`.

* In addition to its redaction features, this app will also include other security and privacy features, such as password protection, encryption, and secure cloud storage. It can also offer advanced features, such as automatic detection of sensitive information, customizable redaction rules, and batch redaction of multiple documents at once.
